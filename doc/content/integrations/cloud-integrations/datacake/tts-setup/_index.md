After finishing Datacake setup, use the **Datacake** [Webhook template]({{< ref "/integrations/webhooks/webhook-templates" >}}) to create a Webhook integration on {{% tts %}}.

To integrate, you only need to fill out the **Webhook ID** field and provide an [API token](https://docs.datacake.de/api/generate-access-token) from Datacake for the authorization.

>**Note:** To see the values of all parameters of the Datacake integration, click on the integration after you created it with the Webhook template. 

Once the setup is finished, you can navigate to device's **Debug** tab on Datacake, where you can see the incoming messages and manipulate or monitor your data.

>**Note:** Check the official Datacake documentation to learn how to [decode the payload](https://docs.datacake.de/lorawan/payload-decoders) received from {{% tts %}}.
